            <p>My passion for engineering came when I first got my hands on an iPod Touch. 8th grade me wanted to see what it was really capable of, and I found a way to jailbreak it and, in the process, learned a lot about technology. I then went on to create my own PCs and build some more for friends and family. Being a nerd started becoming a hobby! It escalated to more complex projects and brings me to where I am now. I know it sounds clich√©, but I love to learn! I hope that in this portfolio, covering a wide range of topics in tech, I demonstrate my ability to figure new things out in a short amount of time. Quick thinking and application of that thinking is what I believe makes me strong in this field.</p>
