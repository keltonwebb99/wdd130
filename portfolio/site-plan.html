      <p>
        Hey there! Welcome to my personal workshop, where I combine the worlds of software engineering, electrical and computer science, and the craft of working with hands-on projects, from intricate electrical devices to the precision of woodworking. This site is a living portfolio, a report of my educational and personal endeavors, and a showcase of my capability to engineer solutions with both silicon chips and sawdust. I'm a builder at heart whether I'm coding or carving and I bring that same innovative spirit and can-do attitude to every challenge I encounter.

        A you navigate through my portfolio, I hope you've gained insight into my blend of technical exerptise and craftiness. I invite you to connect, share ideas, and explore how my diverse skill set can contribute to innovate solutions in tech while doing so securely. Let's embark on a journey of collaboration and discovery, turning concepts into realities.

      <h3>Degree and Certifications</h3>
      <p>
        As a software engineering major with a keen interest in electrical and computer engineering, my academic journey has been anything but one-dimensional. Here, you'll see how I've absorbed knowledge from structured courses and self-guided exploration, from textbooks to the rich resources available on YouTube tutorials and tech forums. My toolkit is filled with certifications in Embedded Systems, Computer Programming, Networking, and Security badges of my commitment to mastering the many languages of technology.

        What makes this site unique is its dual focus: showcasing my skills and reflecting my character. In the same way that I approach my current craft in carpentry, where each detail is measured and each piece tells a story, I apply these principles to my technological creations. My aim is for you to not only recognize the quality and functionality of my work but also to understand the values and principles that drive me as an engineer, a problem-solver, and a reliable team player.

        The journey doesnt stop there, though. I believe in the power of collaboration and continuous learning. Through this site, I invite you to engage with me, whether by providing feedback on my projects, sharing resources, or sparking a discussion about the latest tech advancements. This digital space is designed to be interactive and ever-evolving, just like the tech industry itself.

        So, take a moment to explore. Whether you're here to gauge my suitability for your team, looking for inspiration for your own projects, or just curious about the intersection of tech and craftsmanship, I hope you leave here impressed not just by what Ive done, but by what we could do together. After all, in the digital age, the greatest innovations often come from the most unexpected synergies  like those between the binary world of computing and the timeless craft of carpentry.

      <h3>Projects and Labs</h3>
      <p>
        Take a peek at where I get to put my education to the test. Each project and lab featured here is a showcase of applied knowledge in software engineering, IT, and eelctrical engineering. It does not just demonstrate what I have learned, but also how I can create, solve, and innovate. For an employer this is proof of competency is a various amount of fields. Whether it is embedded system design, software with a security twist, the portfolio here answers the question: What can this engineer do? 
        
        Each project and lab here is like a mini-story about what I can do with all that book-smarts in real-life situations. From building stuff that makes computers think, to guarding against hackers, I've got a bunch of examples that showcase what I can do. For anyone wanting to see what I'm capable of, whether it's a complex gadget or some clever code that keeps things safe, you'll find the proof right here.

        Dive into the heart of my digital workshop. Each project and lab detailed here is a narrative of applied knowledge, a testament to what I've learned and what I can achieve. This isn't just a showcase; it's proof of my multifaceted competency. From embedded system design to software with a security twist, my portfolio is an open book answering the essential question: "What can this engineer do?"

        But this isn't just about displaying past projects; it's about demonstrating potential ones too. For employers, future collaborators, and fellow tech enthusiasts, this is your front-row seat to watch me tackle real-world problems with innovation and determination. It's also a space for connection, where we can discuss industry trends, share insights, and forge new partnerships.

        By highlighting each project's challenges and triumphs, I aim to not only demonstrate technical proficiency but also critical thinking, adaptability, and the sheer joy of creating. Here, I blend logic with imagination, rigorous engineering with craftsmanship. Whether programming a home automation system, designing a security protocol for a local business, or building a custom piece of furniture, the process is as important as the product.
